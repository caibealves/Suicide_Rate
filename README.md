# Suicide_Rate

This repository has the codes used during the production of my work for Suicide Rates in Brazil.

SIM data represent suicide completion data (individuals who died by suicide).  
CNES data represent the healthcare infrastructure in the city (how many and what type of professionals, establishments, services, equipment, and teams are in the city).

We separated the codes in notebooks according to the data mining for suicide deaths and healthcare infrastructure for each region - North, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast, and South. Here is presented the workflow for the North.

The notebooks are for downloading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning.

We added some extra information about the preprocessing analysis, such as the data dictionaries for SIM and CNES datasets and the types of healthcare facilities.
