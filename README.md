# Suicide_Rate

This repository has the codes used during the production of my work for Suicide Rates in Brazil

SIM data represent suicide completion data (individuals who died by suicide). 
SINAN data represent suicide attempt data (individuals who attempted suicide but did not die). 
CNES data represent the healthcare infrastructure in the city (how many and what type of professionals, establishments, services, equipment, and teams in the city).

We separated the codes in notebooks according to the data mining for suicide deaths, suicide attempts, and healthcare infrastructure for each region - North, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast, and South.

The notebooks are for downloading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning.

We added some extra information about the preprocessing analysis, such as the data dictionaries for SINAN and CNES datasets, the form for SINAN (violence form), and the types of healthcare facilities.
